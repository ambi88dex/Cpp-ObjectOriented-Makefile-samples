PROBLEM STATEMENT:- For a given no. of vertices and edges of a graph, determine the number of ways in which graphs can be uniquely coloured.

INPUT:- V: Number of vertices in the graph.
		E: Number of edges in the graph.
		M: Number of colours available to colour the graph.

OUTPUT:- Mentioned in the problem statement

Graph.cpp:- In this file the the basic graph structure is been implemented.

Edge.cpp:- Edge class implementation

Vertices.cpp :- Vertices class Implemenation

inp:- input file to be feeded to the program at run time using command make run

Refer to Makefile for the dependencies among the files.
